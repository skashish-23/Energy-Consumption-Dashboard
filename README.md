# Energy-Consumption-Dashboard

This program generates a dashboard to visualise real-time energy consumption of a household. Some energy data already exists, but new synthetic data is generated in real-time (based on this existing data) and visualised to mimic real-time energy profile of a house.

A synthetic data generator (GAN) will be used. REST API will allow real-time transfer of this data to the main program. The main program will visualise this data.
